Now, let's explain the first 10 terms in the context of a house using the 5W rule. If this aligns with your expectations, I can continue further:

1. **Components**: Components are like rooms in a house. Each room has a specific function, just as each component in React serves a unique purpose. By building individual rooms, you can create an entire house; similarly, by combining components, you build a whole application.

2. **JSX**: JSX is like the blueprint of a house. It defines how the house (or component) will look and where everything will be placed. Just as builders use blueprints to construct homes, React developers use JSX to define the UI.

3. **Props**: Imagine if rooms in your house could be customized based on preferences: color of the walls, type of furniture, etc. Props in React are like those customization options, allowing data to be passed and the component to be rendered accordingly.

4. **State**: The state of a component is similar to the temporary states of a house – lights being on/off, doors being open/closed. Just as the house's state affects its ambiance, a component's state determines its rendering and behavior.

5. **Lifecycle Methods**: These are like the stages of building or renovating a house: laying the foundation, erecting walls, painting, etc. Lifecycle methods in React dictate how a component gets created, updated, and destroyed.

6. **React Hooks**: Imagine adding hooks in your house for hanging clothes, bags, or decorations. React Hooks are tools that let you "hook into" state and lifecycle features from functional components, making them more versatile.

7. **Context API**: If a house had an intercom system that allowed messages to be broadcast to any room, it'd be like the Context API. It provides a way to share values between components without passing props through every level.

8. **Redux**: Imagine a central control room in a house where all data and actions are managed. Redux in React acts as that central state management system, ensuring consistency throughout the app.

9. **Virtual DOM**: It's like a virtual model of your house. Before making any actual changes to the house, you simulate them on the model. Similarly, the Virtual DOM allows React to make virtual changes before updating the real DOM for performance efficiency.

10. **ReactDOM**: Just as you need a bridge between the house's blueprint and the actual construction, ReactDOM acts as the bridge between React components (blueprint) and the DOM (actual construction), rendering components on the web page.

11. **Class Components**: These are like traditional brick-and-mortar houses that have been around for a while. They're based on ES6 classes and offer more features out-of-the-box, like lifecycle methods.

12. **Functional Components**: Think of these as modern modular homes. They're simpler, more concise, and with the advent of React Hooks, they can now perform many of the tasks that were once exclusive to class components.

13. **useEffect**: Imagine a house where lights automatically turn on when it gets dark and turn off at dawn. `useEffect` in React allows side effects (like data fetching, DOM manipulation) in functional components based on certain conditions or dependencies.

14. **useState**: It's like installing adjustable lights in a room that can be dimmed or brightened. `useState` lets you add state to functional components, and dynamically alter it.

15. **Render**: Imagine showing someone a finished room in your house. Rendering in React is the process of displaying a component (or room) based on its state and props.

16. **Higher-Order Components (HOC)**: Consider a house with a foundation that supports different types of extensions or attachments. An HOC is a function that takes a component and returns a new component with added features or data.

17. **React Router**: It's akin to the pathways and doors in your house that guide visitors from one room to another. React Router manages navigation and URL paths within your React application.

18. **PureComponent**: Imagine a room in your house that you rarely change. A `PureComponent` in React optimizes rendering by doing a shallow comparison of state and props, only updating when there's a genuine change.

19. **Keys**: These are like unique nameplates outside every room. In React, keys help identify items in a list, ensuring efficient updates and rendering.

20. **React DevTools**: Think of these as special glasses that let you see the blueprint layout overlaid on your house, allowing you to inspect and debug. React DevTools is a browser extension that helps developers inspect the React component hierarchy, state, and props.

21. **Fragments**: Imagine wanting to add multiple furniture pieces to a room without individually naming each one. React Fragments let you group multiple elements without adding an extra node to the DOM.

22. **Portals**: It's like having a magical door in your living room that leads directly outside, bypassing all other rooms. React Portals allow you to render a child component outside its parent's DOM hierarchy.

23. **Suspense**: When renovating a room, you might hang a curtain to keep the mess hidden until it's ready to be unveiled. Similarly, React's Suspense lets you defer rendering parts of your app until certain conditions are met.

24. **Lazy Loading**: It's akin to only furnishing a room when you're expecting guests. Lazy loading in React allows you to load components only when they're needed, improving performance.

25. **Memo**: Imagine rooms in your house that remember how they looked the last time and only change if something new is added. Using `React.memo`, React can memorize the rendered output of a component and avoid unnecessary renders.

26. **useRef**: Think of this as marking a specific location in your house with a beacon, allowing you to return to it anytime. In React, `useRef` provides a way to access the same mutable reference object without causing a re-render.

27. **useCallback**: It's akin to setting up a routine for locking up your house: checking each door once, and then remembering that method. In React, `useCallback` memorizes a callback function, preventing excessive recalculations unless dependencies change.

28. **useContext**: Imagine having a centralized music system in your house, accessible from every room without wiring each room separately. Using `useContext`, React components can easily access context data without manually passing props through each level.

29. **useReducer**: Consider a complex home security system with multiple sensors and alarms. Instead of individually managing each one, you'd want a centralized system. `useReducer` provides a more predictable state management for complex state logic in React.

30. **Create React App (CRA)**: Think of this as a pre-designed house blueprint. Instead of drafting from scratch, you get a standard design. CRA offers a ready-to-use environment to kick-start your React applications without manual setup.

31. **React Fiber**: Envision a team of contractors and builders working efficiently on different parts of a house simultaneously. Fiber is React's re-architecture, allowing for incremental rendering and better prioritization of tasks.

32. **PropTypes**: Imagine a checklist for each room detailing its dimensions, paint color, etc. `PropTypes` allows you to specify the type of data a component should receive, adding an extra layer of validation.

33. **Context**: This is like the central theme or aesthetic of your house, which is consistently applied to all rooms. In React, Context provides a way to share values between components without explicitly passing them as props.

34. **Forward Ref**: Consider secret passages in your house that allow direct access to otherwise hidden rooms. `Forward Ref` lets a parent component directly access functions or attributes of a child component.

35. **Batching**: If you have multiple rooms to clean, doing them simultaneously rather than one-by-one would be efficient. React batches multiple `setState` updates to reduce redundant renders, optimizing performance.

36. **Synthetic Events**: These are like standardized security protocols for every door and window in your house. In React, Synthetic Events offer a cross-browser wrapper around native browser events, ensuring consistent behavior.

37. **Controlled Components**: Think of automated rooms where the lighting, temperature, and music are controlled by a central system. In React, controlled components have their state managed by React, offering consistent and predictable behavior.

38. **Uncontrolled Components**: This is like a room with manual switches where guests can adjust settings as they prefer. In React, uncontrolled components keep their own state, without React's intervention.

39. **React Native**: Envision building a house and then replicating its design for a mobile home. React Native allows you to develop mobile applications using the same React principles.

40. **Flux**: Consider a centralized ventilation system distributing air throughout your house. Flux is an architecture that promotes unidirectional data flow, ensuring data consistency in React applications.

41. **Render Props**: It's like offering a customizable room where guests can choose decor while adhering to the house's theme. Render Props in React is a technique where a component's render logic is shared among multiple components.

42. **React Children**: Consider the individual elements in a room - the furniture, decor, and more. In React, Children refers to the contents inside a component, which can be easily manipulated with `React.Children` utilities.

43. **Mounting**: It's like the initial setup of a room, from placing the furniture to hanging curtains. In React, mounting is the phase in which a component is being created and inserted into the DOM.

44. **Updating**: Think of this as renovating a room, maybe repainting the walls or changing the furniture. In React, updating is the process when a component re-renders due to changes in props or state.

45. **Unmounting**: This is akin to tearing down a room or a section of the house. In React, unmounting is the phase when a component is being removed from the DOM.

46. **Error Boundaries**: Imagine safety nets in your house that prevent minor issues from escalating into major disasters. Error boundaries in React are components that catch JavaScript errors in their child component tree and render a fallback UI.

47. **setState**: Envision a control panel in your house to adjust lights, temperature, etc. In React, `setState` is the method used to update the component's state and trigger a re-render.

48. **shouldComponentUpdate**: Think of a room's door that asks, "Do you really need to change anything?" before you enter. This lifecycle method in React allows optimization by letting you conditionally render a component.

49. **getDerivedStateFromProps**: Picture sensors in your house that adjust room settings based on outside conditions. This static method in React enables a component to update its state based on changes in props.

50. **ComponentDidMount**: It's like an alert you receive when a room's setup is complete and ready for use. This lifecycle method in React runs after the component output has been rendered to the DOM.

51. **ComponentDidUpdate**: Imagine receiving notifications whenever changes are made to a room. This React lifecycle method is invoked right after updating occurs, letting you operate on the DOM or fetch new data.

52. **ComponentWillUnmount**: It's akin to a signal indicating that a room will soon be off-limits. This method in React lets you perform necessary cleanup before the component is destroyed.

53. **Reconciliation**: Picture a quick assessment tool comparing an old room layout with a new design plan. In React, reconciliation is the algorithm used to compare changes with the Virtual DOM to update the real DOM efficiently.

54. **Mixins**: Think of these as decoration themes or templates that can be applied to multiple rooms. Though largely outdated in modern React, mixins were once used to share behavior between components.

55. **Spread Attributes**: It's like distributing house decor uniformly across rooms. In JSX, spread attributes allow for more concise passing of multiple props to a component.

56. **Context Provider**: Imagine the main control unit supplying electricity to the entire house. The Provider in React's Context API allows components to consume context data.

57. **Context Consumer**: It's akin to devices in rooms drawing power from the main electrical unit. The Consumer in React's Context API uses data provided by the corresponding Provider.

58. **Redux Store**: Think of this as the main storage or attic of your house, holding all belongings. In Redux, the store holds the entire state tree of the application.

59. **Redux Actions**: Envision buttons in rooms that activate various functionalities like lights or fans. In Redux, actions are payloads of information sent from the application to the store.

60. **Redux Reducers**: Imagine sorting machines in the attic that organize your belongings based on specific rules. Reducers in Redux specify how the application's state changes in response to actions.

61. **Redux Middleware**: Consider it as the house's security system, inspecting everyone that comes in or out and possibly altering their behavior. Middleware in Redux provides a third-party extension point between dispatching an action and the moment it reaches the reducer.

62. **Redux Thunk**: Think of it as a multi-tasking tool in your house, allowing you to perform multiple actions simultaneously or in sequence. Redux Thunk is middleware that lets you write action creators that return a function instead of an action.

63. **Virtual DOM**: It's akin to having a miniature model of your house, where you can test changes before applying them to the real house. Virtual DOM is a lightweight representation of the actual DOM elements, and React uses it to determine UI changes efficiently.

64. **JSX**: Picture an innovative blueprint that combines the layout of your house with interior designs. JSX is a syntax extension for JavaScript, enabling you to write UI structures in a manner similar to HTML but within JavaScript.

65. **Hooks**: Think of them as modern gadgets you can add to your rooms, enhancing their functionality. Hooks in React are functions that let you "hook into" React features from functional components.

66. **Immutable State**: It's like having rooms in your house that once set up, can't be altered directly but can be replicated with changes. Immutability in React (and Redux) ensures that state isn't changed directly, promoting predictable behavior.

67. **React’s Component Lifecycle**: Envision a lifecycle of a room from its construction to eventual demolition. In React, each component goes through several phases - mounting, updating, and unmounting, each with its lifecycle methods.

68. **Lifting State Up**: Imagine consolidating the control panels of various rooms into one central control unit. In React, this refers to moving shared state to a common ancestor component to facilitate data flow.

69. **Props Drilling**: Consider passing a message through several rooms before it reaches its destination. In React, props drilling is the practice of passing data through multiple levels of components.

70. **Composition**: It's like designing a room by assembling various modular units or furniture pieces. In React, composition is a pattern where components are used together to achieve more complex UIs, favoring it over inheritance.

71. **Refs**: Imagine having direct access points to certain areas or items in your house. In React, refs provide a way to access the DOM nodes or React elements created in the render method.

72. **React Bootstrap**: Think of this as a pre-made interior design package for your house. React Bootstrap is a library that integrates Bootstrap styling and components into React.

73. **React Helmet**: It's akin to adding specific tags or labels to rooms in your house. React Helmet manages the metadata of your web pages in React applications, beneficial for SEO.

74. **useState vs useReducer**: Consider `useState` as individual switches for lights and `useReducer` as a complex control panel. While both deal with state management, `useReducer` offers more control for complex state logic.

75. **Server Side Rendering (SSR)**: It’s like previewing how your house will look once it’s built, even before actual construction. SSR in React is the process of rendering components on the server rather than in the browser, facilitating faster initial load times and improved SEO.

76. **React.memo**: Imagine a room that recalls its last setup and avoids unnecessary rearrangements. `React.memo` is a higher order component that memorizes the rendered output of the wrapped component preventing unnecessary renders.

77. **Concurrent Mode**: Think of multiple teams working on different rooms in your house, starting and stopping tasks as required to optimize overall progress. Concurrent Mode in React allows multiple tasks to be processed in the background, improving user experience.

78. **Event Handling**: It’s like setting up reactions in your house, such as lights turning on when someone enters a room. In React, event handling is the mechanism to listen to user actions like clicks, input changes, and more.

79. **Hot Module Replacement (HMR)**: Imagine being able to replace a piece of furniture in a room without disrupting the rest of the room's setup. HMR in React allows developers to replace modules in a running application without a full reload.

80. **React Query**: Think of an automated system that fetches items from your attic based on what you currently need in a room. React Query automates fetching, caching, and state management in React applications.

    Absolutely! Let's tackle the last set of React terms:

81. **Suspense**: Think of it as an under-construction sign placed in a room of your house while waiting for new furniture to arrive. In React, Suspense lets your components “wait” for something before rendering, like data fetching.

82. **Lazy Loading**: Imagine your house light system turning on only in rooms you're currently in or about to enter, saving energy. Lazy loading in React allows components to be loaded only when they're needed, optimizing performance and reducing initial load times.

83. **Higher-Order Component (HOC)**: Picture a customizable room template that you can use in multiple parts of the house. In React, HOCs are functions that take a component and return a new component with added properties or behavior.

84. **React Fragments**: Think of them as invisible dividers in a room that don't add any extra structure but help organize space. React Fragments let you group a list of children without adding extra nodes to the DOM.

85. **React Router**: It's like a guided tour system in your house, directing visitors from room to room based on their interests. React Router manages navigation in your application, defining multiple routes and their corresponding components.

86. **Stateless Component**: Imagine rooms in your house with fixed setups, never changing regardless of external factors. Stateless components in React are those that simply receive props and render them to the UI without managing any internal state.

87. **Stateful Component**: It's like a room equipped with sensors and automation, adjusting its setup based on external inputs. Stateful components in React maintain their own data state and decide how to render themselves.

88. **Pure Components**: Picture a room in your house that only changes when you introduce new furniture or decor. In React, Pure Components are those that don’t re-render unless their state or props change.

89. **Portals**: Think of them as magical doorways in your house that transport you outside instantly. React Portals provide a first-class way to render child components into a DOM node outside of the parent DOM hierarchy.

90. **React DevTools**: This is like an advanced diagnostic tool to check the health and structure of your house. React DevTools is a browser extension that helps developers inspect a React Renderer, including the component hierarchy, its state, props, and more.

91. **Context Selector**: Imagine a smart system in your house that knows exactly which rooms need heating based on their occupancy. In React, Context Selectors allow a component to read a value from the Context and re-render only when that value changes.

92. **Server Components**: It’s like having remote-controlled rooms in your house, where the setup is decided elsewhere but executed in your room. Server Components in React allow parts of a UI to be rendered on the server, blending server and client rendering.

93. **React Testing Library**: Think of it as safety tests for each room in your house, ensuring everything functions as expected. The React Testing Library is a set of helpers for testing React components, focusing on their behaviors.

94. **React Patterns**: These are best practice designs, like ideal layouts for rooms in different houses. In React, patterns are recognized solutions to common problems or best practices in crafting React applications.

95. **Key Prop**: Imagine labeling every item in your house so they can be identified and tracked easily. In React, the `key` prop is a special attribute you need to specify when creating lists of elements.

96. **Functional Components**: Consider these as rooms with a single purpose, like a reading nook. In React, functional components are simpler versions of class components, without lifecycle methods or internal state (before Hooks).

97. **JSX Pragma**: Think of it as the foundation blueprint of your house, defining how other structures will be added. JSX Pragma dictates the function JSX transpiles to in the compilation process.

98. **React Profiler**: It's like a utility bill breaking down energy consumption in each room. The React Profiler measures how components render and identifies potential performance bottlenecks.

99. **React StrictMode**: Consider it a rigorous home inspection ensuring all parts of the house adhere to the latest safety standards. StrictMode is a tool in React for highlighting potential problems in applications during development.

100. **React Fiber Reconciliation**: Picture a home renovation team assessing the smallest changes needed to transform one room version to another. This refers to React's algorithm to efficiently update the UI by comparing the current view with a new one.
